        <code>P</code>
        <p>Innate: Kayn wields an ancient, sentient weapon, that battles with him for control. Enemy champions drop orbs for each instance of damage (excluding damage over time) they receive from Kayn and everytime he scores a takedown against them. Melee champions drop red orbs and  ranged champions drop blue orbs. Red orbs grant progress towards Rhaast Rhaast while blue orbs do so for the Shadow Assassin Shadow Assassin. Orbs will remain on the ground until automatically collected by Kayn regardless of range once he leaves combat, filling a bar above his portrait.</p>
        <p>Once the bar is filled, Kayn can return to the summoning platform to interact with his portrait to either be overwhelmed by Rhaast or expel him to become the Shadow Assassin, or wait 4 minutes until the other form becomes available, reduced by 5 seconds for each collected orb of their type after that. After selecting a form, Kayn transforms over 6 seconds, during which he is  invulnerable,  untargetable, and unable to act. Kayn cannot choose a form if he is unable to cast abilities.</p>

        <p>Kayn dashes in the target direction, dealing physical damage to enemies he passes through, before swinging his scythe, dealing the same damage to surrounding enemies.</p>

        <p>Reaping Slash's dash speed scales with Kayn's total movement speed.</p>

        <p>Kayn performs an upwards sweep with his scythe in the target direction, dealing physical damage to all enemies within a line and slowing them by 90% decaying over 1.5 seconds.</p>
        <p>If Kayn has become the shadow assassin, Blade's Reach's range is increased by 200, additionally, Kayn conjures a living shadow at the casting position to perform Blade's Reach instead of him, reducing the cast time to 0</p>
        <p>If Rhaast has overtaken Kayn, Blade's Reach knocks enemies up for 1 second</p>

        <code>E</code>
        <p>Kayn gains 40% bonus movement speed, ghosting and the ability to ignore terrain collision for a duration.</p>
        <p>If Kayn has been in combat with enemy champions within the last 3 seconds, Shadow Step will instead last 1.5 seconds.</p>
        <p>Kayn heals himself upon moving through terrain for the first time from casting Shadow Step and he gains unobstructed vision while inside.</p>
        <p>Duration at levels:</p>

        <code>R</code>
        <p>Active: Kayn vanishes and dashes to a marked enemy champion. Upon arrival, he channels for up to 2.5 seconds, attaching to the target and revealing them. Umbral Trespass can be recast after 0.75 seconds during the channel, and does so automatically if the channel ends without reactivation or is interrupted.</p>
        <p>Recast: After a 0.75-second delay, Kayn deals physical damage to the target and dashes out from their body in the target direction while still being untargetable.</p>
        <p>If Kayn has become the shadow assassin Umbral Trespass gains up to 200 bonus cast range and emerge range. Additionally, emerging will reset The Darkin Scythe's cooldown.
